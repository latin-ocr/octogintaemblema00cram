In the middle of the leth century this class of
books assumed in Italy the character of a distinct
kind of literature ; and the tendeney to multiply
books of this class passed to Franc Gemny, Hol-
land, Spain, ancl Engiancr until &heir issue was inv
credihly large-so large as to for 'almost a con-
siderable libi-ary, when they were brought together
by the diligence of collectore. At this day, except
in libraries unusually comprehensive, it is hardly
possible to ‚form a notiori of the number of these
works οι· of their characteristic quaintness and
formal ingr-nuity. The symbolism of the Midd'ie
Ages was secularized for ¹their productim, and art,
although it had then grown eminently realistic, was
inexhaustihle in the eccentricity, as well as the
variety oi· the conceptions which it sought to turn
into pictures for their embellishment.

Such works, as a class, have not only long since
passed out of fashion, but the specimens of this by· .
gone literature which occasionally turn up at book
sales are now so rare as to command very high ξ
prices. There is no class of books more attractive ³
to the true bibliopolist who cares for distinctive ex-
cellence rather than rarity 3 and we find such books
in what we may term gentlemanly librarios de·
servedly preserved as tokens of an educated tasio.
The aphorisms and adages which the Messrs.
Lougman have just published, with their curious
illustratione, have been taken from Jacob Cats,

χ of Holland, and Robert Farlie, the Scot3 but
v the letter-prees has been translated and edited by
fflchard Pigott, and the illustratione have been
freely rendered by John Leighton, F.S.A. The
moral emblema of Jacob Cats are not the most
characteristic of their series, but they have
received the eulogy of Daniel Heinsius and
of two eminent persons, who are designated
Ε as two of Holland‘s greatest lyrists, Hoogstraten
and Zecuwes. These great, but as regards English
readers absolutely unknown, authorities have natu-
rally fixed upon Jacob Cats, a Dutchman, as the
symbolist par excellence. But we will not be a party
for a moment to the deception of our readers into
the belief ‘that he is the best of his kind.
There are infinitely better things than these
to ‘be found among this class of books, and
which will better reward researcli and reproduction
hereaiter. We speak‚ as knowing the class, with-
out wishing to oppress the reader with our preteri-
sions to erudition. At the same time, we are
most solicitous that we should not be mis-
taken. Th-is is an elegant result of modern,
artistic, and typographical resources. The freedom
of modern handling is added to the redierche ualities
of archaic conception, and the result is a, boo which
reflects credit on all concerned in its publication.
